# NestJS

This is my notes from the official doc

[Ref](https://nestjs.com/)

## What is NestJS?

Node.js web app framework (open source MIT)

## Introduction

NestJS uses many frameworks, one of them is `Express` by default

Why not just use `Express`?
- NestJS provides abstraction! (Like Next.js to React)
- NestJS provides **architecture**! (Similar to Angular's)

## Installation

Use Nest CLI or clone a project

Scaffold project with Nest CLI (recommended)
- Create new dir
  - Nest core files
  - Nest modules
```bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
nest new project-name
```
