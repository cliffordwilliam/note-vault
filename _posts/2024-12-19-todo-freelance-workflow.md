Goal: Need to make back-end and front-end locally first

Find good ref to setup both back-end and front-end

Back-end
- Back-end can check the NestJS doc and Prisma doc to see examples on how to integrate
- Need to have these features
  - CRUD
  - Get + pagination + search
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Make sure to implement my way, have routes modules only and features modules only
 
Front-end
- Just read the doc to see what is new in Next.js now
- Material UI is easy to use those are just components
